      -(supports up to 9 Zettabytes)
-Enhanced Features: UEFI supports larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and a graphical user interface with mouse support13.

-Boot Process: Like BIOS, UEFI initializes hardware components and loads the operating system, but it does so more efficiently12.

-Secure Boot: UEFI includes a feature called Secure Boot, which helps prevent unauthorized software from loading during the boot process13.

-Compatibility: UEFI is backward compatible with BIOS, allowing it to work with older systems and software2.
