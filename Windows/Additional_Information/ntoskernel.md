ntoskrnl.exe (short for Windows NT operating system kernel executable) is a critical component of the Windows operating system. Here are some key points about it:

- Memory Management: It keeps track of physical and virtual memory usage and moves data between RAM and disk storage.

- Processor Scheduling: It determines which processes get access to CPU resources at what times.

- Hardware Abstraction: It provides a consistent interface for software to interact with hardware components.

- I/O Management: It controls data transfer between hardware devices and system memory.

- Security Management: It manages objects like files, registry keys, processes, and threads, including access control.

In essence, ntoskrnl.exe provides the foundation on top of which the rest of Windows and your applications run. 

It initializes during the boot process and continues running in the background, managing these core OS responsibilities.
