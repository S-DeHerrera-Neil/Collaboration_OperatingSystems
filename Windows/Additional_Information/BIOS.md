BIOS (Basic Input/Output System): A firmware stored in a chip on the Motherboard.
- Initializing Hardware: The BIOS performs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to check and initialize hardware components like the CPU, RAM, and storage devices.
 
- Booting the Operating System: After initializing the hardware, the BIOS locates and loads the bootloader from a storage device, which then starts the operating system.

- Providing Runtime Services: The BIOS offers low-level services to the operating system and software, such as keyboard input and display output.
