Windows Boot Manager (BOOTMGR) is a critical component in the Windows boot process.

- Role in Boot Process: BOOTMGR is the first program launched by the BIOS or UEFI when you start your computer. It is responsible for loading the rest of the Windows operating system.

- Reading Boot Configuration Data (BCD): BOOTMGR reads the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store, which contains the configuration settings and boot options for the operating system.

- Loading winload.exe: After reading the BCD, BOOTMGR loads winload.exe, which then initializes the Windows kernel and essential drivers.


    - Replaces NTLDR: BOOTMGR replaced the older NTLDR (NT Loader) used in previous versions of Windows
